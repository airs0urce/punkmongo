How I got prism.js and prism.css:

- Download ZIP of this repo https://github.com/airs0urce/prism. This is Prism.js with new language definition - mongoquery
- Install http-server: 
$ npm install -g http-server
- Unpack zip, go inside the folder and run 
$ http-server
- See what address http server started on and go to download.html, for example:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/download.html

- Select "Minified version" and in Languages uncheck all except "Mongo Query"
- Go to page bottom and click "Download JS" and "Download CSS"
