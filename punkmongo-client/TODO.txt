Add document number ijn query results



Visual Explain 
-------------------------------
Query execution statistics for the winning plan

(green) Documents Returned: 100 (nReturn, Number of documents that match the query conditions. Ideally: nReturn = totalKeysExamined = totalDocsExamined)
(blue) Actual Query Execution Time: 3ms (Total time in milliseconds required for query plan selection and  query execution)

Index Keys Examined: 100 (totalKeysExamined, Ideally: nReturn = totalKeysExamined = totalDocsExamined)
Documents Examined: 100 (totalDocsExamined Number of documents scanned)
Sorted in Memory: true/false (If MOngoDB can use an index scan to obtain the requested sorted order, the result will be false, otherwise true)

Query used the folowing index  (If the query planner selects an index, the explain result includes an IXSCAN stage)
    OR
No index available for this query
