# PunkMongo

Tool for administration MongoDB over the Web inspired by RockMongo.

Development in progress.
The goal of the project is to make free, fast, predictable, easy to use MongoDB client.

For now to start server and client:
1) Install Vue Cli: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html 
2) Make sure mongodb running on local machine on port 27017 (or change configuration in config.js)
3) Go to both "punkmongo-api" and "punkmongo-client" and run 
$ npm install
4) Run both folders "punkmongo-api" and "punkmongo-client" run:
$ npm start

Sure, this is not final way how you start the project, but approach used for development before I make first release .

I test all features on MongoDB >= v4.0. If you have earlier versions it's possoble that some features will not work or will work incorrectly.
