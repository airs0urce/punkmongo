# punkmongo

Development in progress.
The goal of the project is to make free, fast, predictable, easy to use MongoDB client.

For now to start server and client:
1) Make sure mongodb running on local machine on port 27017 (or change configuration in config.js)
2) Go to both "punkmongo-api" and "punkmongo-client" and run 
$ npm install
3) Run both folders "punkmongo-api" and "punkmongo-client" run:
$ npm start

Sure, this is not final way how you start the project, but approach used for development before I make first release .
